How to set this scenario up:

1. npm install this app
2. create a new folder outside this repo where you copy the folders `webapp/lib/core` and `webapp/lib/ui`.
3. serve that folder via http for example via npm module http-server, make sure __CORS is enabled__ (e.g. via flag ``--cors``).
4. copy the ip address under which your folder is served to your hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts) and link it to host _myPDFExampleSite.com__
5. run the app via npm run start
